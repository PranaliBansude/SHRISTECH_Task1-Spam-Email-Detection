Explaining my AI internship task/project completed at @Shris Tech.   Grateful for the hands-on learning experience.
# Task 1 – AI-Based Spam Email Detection System

## Objective
To classify emails as spam or non-spam using machine learning techniques.

## Description
This project implements an AI-based spam email detection system.  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used for text preprocessing.  
TF-IDF is applied for feature extraction, and a machine learning model is trained for classification.

## Output
The system predicts whether an email is spam or not and displays model accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Scikit-learn

This task was completed as part of the AI internship.
